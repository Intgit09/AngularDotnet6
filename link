This diagram represents the use cases described in the scenario:

User Authentication: Internal and external users authenticate through the SSO application to access the Bill Status Application Portal.
User Registration: Unregistered users can register with the Bill Status Application Portal, providing necessary user information. External users also provide provider information during registration.
Bill Status Page: After authentication, users are redirected to the Bill Status Page where they can enter search criteria. Internal users have additional options such as searching by bill ID. Users can download attachment files from the search results.
