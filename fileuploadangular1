Sure, here's a scenario based on the information you provided:

1. **User Login**: 
   - Users can access the Bill Status Application Portal.
   - Users have two types of roles: internal user and external user.
   - Users first log in to the application using Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication.

2. **Select Bill Status Enroll**:
   - After logging in, users click on the "Select Bill Status" option to enroll in the bill status service.

3. **Registration**:
   - If the user is not registered, they need to provide user information for registration.
   - If the user is an external user, they also need to provide provider information during registration.

4. **Login after Registration**:
   - After successful registration, the user logs in to the application again using SSO authentication.

5. **Role Check**:
   - Upon login, the system checks the user's role.
   - If the user has either the "pro_internal" or "pro_external" role, they are redirected to the Bill Status Page.
   
6. **Bill Status Page**:
   - The Bill Status Page consists of two tabs: Claim Search and Bill Search.
   - The Bill Search tab is only visible to users with the "pro_internal" role.

7. **Searching for Bills**:
   - Users can enter search criteria in the Claim Search tab or input a Bill ID in the Bill Search tab.
   - Upon submission, the system displays the search results in a grid format below the search tabs.

8. **External User Provider Selection**:
   - If the user is a "pro_external" user, they need to select a provider before being redirected to the Bill Status Page.

9. **Result Grid**:
   - In the result grid, users have the option to download bill attachments in PDF format.
   - Additionally, users can view payment details associated with the bills.

This scenario outlines the sequence of actions and interactions for both internal and external users within the Bill Status Application Portal. Let me know if you need further clarification or if there's anything else you'd like to add!
